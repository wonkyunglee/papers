Nataraj et al. \cite{nataraj2013sarvam} proposed a large scale malware search and retrieval system. In this paper, he proposes a method to retrieve fingerprints from malware image and retrieves similar samples through nearest neighbor search. Upchurch et al. \cite{upchurch2015variant} introduced a framework for detecting variant malware through similarity testing. This framework extracted the static features using BitShred, TLSH, sdhash, ssdeep, and compared them to determine whether they were similar malware. Palahan et al. \cite{palahan2013extraction} proposed a method of comparing similarities between malware by extracting significant malicious behaviors from the system call dependency graph and comparing them. Several neural IR models have been proposed in the document retrieval domain, and many models have been studied to obtain a good representation of text\cite{mitra2017learning,cohen2016end,huang2013learning}.

 Chih-Kuan et al. \cite{yeh2017learning} trained Canonical Correlated AutoEncoder models using label-correlation sensitive loss function as a way to obtain multilabel embedding. In this paper, he showes that the relationship between labels with dependency is trained end-to-end and solves the multi-label classification task, and proved to be effective for missing label problem of multilabel classification.
