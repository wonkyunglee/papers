\section{Future Works}

The current method requires that all labels be correct. If not, the model can be vulnerable to noise. But getting the correct label in malware domain is not easy. Therefore, label noise-robust model should be created to estimate the real label of malware samples from features of malware through denoising. If we create MR system through this, we could make more semantic-aware malware information system. In addition, quick response to new samples is an important part of the MR system, but in case of deep learning model, it takes time to train. It is also our future work to solve by using continual learning or online update.
